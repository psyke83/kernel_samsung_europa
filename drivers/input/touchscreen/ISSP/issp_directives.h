#ifndef INC_ISSP_DIRECTIVES
#define INC_ISSP_DIRECTIVES

// This directive will enable a Genral Purpose test-point on P1.7
// It can be toggled as needed to measure timing, execution, etc...
// A "Test Point" sets a GPIO pin of the host processor high or low. This GPIO
// pin can be observed with an oscilloscope to verify the timing of key
// programming steps. TPs have been added in main() that set Port 0, pin 1
// high during bulk erase, during each block write and during security write.
// The timing of these programming steps should be verified as correct as part
// of the validation process of the final program.

// ****************************************************************************
// ************* USER ATTENTION REQUIRED: TARGET SUPPLY VOLTAGE ***************
// ****************************************************************************
// This directive causes the proper Initialization vector #3 to be sent
// to the Target, based on what the Target Vdd programming voltage will
// be. Either 5V (if #define enabled) or 3.3V (if #define disabled).
//#define TARGET_VOLTAGE_IS_5V


// ****************************************************************************
// **************** USER ATTENTION REQUIRED: PROGRAMMING MODE *****************
// ****************************************************************************
// This directive selects whether code that uses reset programming mode or code
// that uses power cycle programming is use. Reset programming mode uses the
// external reset pin (XRES) to enter programming mode. Power cycle programming
// mode uses the power-on reset to enter programming mode.
// Applying signals to various pins on the target device must be done in a
// deliberate order when using power cycle mode. Otherwise, high signals to GPIO
// pins on the target will power the PSoC through the protection diodes.
//#define RESET_MODE


//#define TX_ON
//#define LCD_ON

// ****************************************************************************
// ****************** USER ATTENTION REQUIRED: TARGET PSOC ********************
// ****************************************************************************
// The directives below enable support for various PSoC devices. The root part
// number to be programmed should be un-commented so that its value becomes
// defined.  All other devices should be commented out.
// Select one device to be supported below:
